The <!DOCTYPE html> declaration is used to inform the web browser about the version of HTML that the page is written in. It is not an HTML tag; it is an instruction to the web browser about what version of HTML the page is written in.In HTML5, the declaration is simplified to <!DOCTYPE html>. This is enough to specify that the document is HTML5. 
Example:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Page Title</title>
</head>
<body>

<h1>This is a Heading</h1>
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>

</body>
</html>

In this example, <!DOCTYPE html> is the DOCTYPE declaration, specifying that this document is written in HTML5. The declaration should be the very first thing in your HTML document, before the <html> tag.
