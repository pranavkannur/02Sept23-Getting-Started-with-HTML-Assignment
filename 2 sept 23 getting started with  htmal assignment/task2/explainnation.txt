Comments in HTML are used to explain the code and are ignored by browsers. They can be used to: 1)Improve code readability: Comments can help other developers understand your code better. They can provide explanations about the functionality of a particular section of code. 2)Hide code: Sometimes, you might want to prevent a section of code from executing, but donâ€™t want to delete it entirely. Wrapping that code in comments will keep it in the source code but prevent it from running.
